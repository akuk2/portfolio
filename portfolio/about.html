<h1>About me</h1>
<img src="css/media/happy.jpg">
<h3>My name is Adam Kuk (pronounced "cook") and web development is my passion.
   Ever since my inception, my eyes were glued to the screens
   of televisions, computers, and later mobile phones.
   As I grew older, I found myself interested in the
   science and mindset that goes into developing
   the funny graphics and text we see on screens.
</p> <br>
<h3>I am also an engineering student at [REDACTED], my goal is to become
   a successful software engineer through hard work.
   I will use my troubleshooting and logical skills
   to solve any problem I am faced with, and I aspire
   to use my skills to their fullest potential.</p>
